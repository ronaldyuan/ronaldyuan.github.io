                  Welcome to my personal website! There’s not much to see here, but here’s a little about myself: <br><br>

                  A first-year student at Brown University, currently interested in International Affairs, Computer Science, and Economics. <br>

                  Feeding my everlasting curiosity through books, podcasts, and more twitter than I’d like to admit. <br>

                  Focused on learning about technologies like distributed ledgers, histories of inequality, and critically bettering the world. <br><br>


                  Outside of academics, I fence as a Division I varsity athlete where sabre is my weapon of choice. <br>

                  Originally from Birmingham, Alabama and a graduate of Hoover High School. <br>

                  Just dreaming of traveling the world by bike. Contact me with the links below (email works best)<br><br><br>


                  Note: This personal website is currently under development. A new page should be coming in the coming months of 2020 as I am learning new code!
